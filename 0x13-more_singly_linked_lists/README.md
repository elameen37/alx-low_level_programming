# *0x13. C - More singly linked lists*

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the second part of single linked lists

At the end of this project, I was able to solve this questions:
  
* How to use linked lists
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.
1. Function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.
2. Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.
3. Function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.
4. Function that frees a listint_t list.
5. Function that frees a listint_t list v2.
6. Function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).
7. Function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.
8. Function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.
9. Function that inserts a new node at a given position.
10. Function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
11. Function that reverses a listint_t linked list.
12. Function that prints a listint_t linked list.
13. Function that frees a listint_t list.
14. Function that finds the loop in a linked list.
