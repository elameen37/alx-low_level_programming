# 0x1B C - Sorting algorithms & Big O :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concepts of sorting algoritms and was a project done along a great partner [Daniela Vasquez](https://github.com/DaniVasq)

At the end of this project, We were able to achieve:
  
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
1. Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
2. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
3. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
4. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence
5. Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm
6. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm
7. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge sort algorithm
8. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm 
9. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm
10. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bitonic sort algorithm 
11. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
12. Function that sorts a deck of cards.
